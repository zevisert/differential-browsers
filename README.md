# differential-browsers

> ðŸ’¡ This library is a fork of [Polymer/tools/packages/browser-capabilities](https://github.com/Polymer/tools/tree/master/packages/browser-capabilities), but the repository has been dead for two years. The biggest offender here is Anaheim edge that is now chromium based.


A JavaScript library that detects browser capabilities from a user agent string.

The following keywords are supported. See [differential-browsers.ts](https://github.com/zevisert/differential-browsers/blob/master/src/differential-browsers.ts) for the latest browser support matrix.

## TODO: 

- [ ] `push` is supported for `<link rel="preload" ...>`, but `modulepreload` is not available
- [ ] `es2019` - covering: `flat` and `flatMap` `Array` methods, try .. catch` optional binding, `Object.fromEntries`, stable `Array.sort`, and more
- [ ] `es2020` - covering: optional chaining (`?.`), nullish coalescing (`??`), `export * as namespace` and `BigInt`, and more
